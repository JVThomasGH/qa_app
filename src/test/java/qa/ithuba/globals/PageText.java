                ABOUT NATIONAL LOTTERY
                                
                In 2015, ITHUBA Holdings (RF) Proprietary Limited was appointed as the official National Lottery operator of South Africa by the National Lotteries Commission.
                When we took over the National Lottery, we promised to optimise the consumer experience by reinvigorating the National Lottery’s offering. Since then, we have offered bigger and better jackpots that have been won by ordinary South Africans, and as a result, our National Lottery Distribution Trust Fund contributions to socio-economic development through various good cause charity initiatives, remains impactful.
                In August 2018, we announced the biggest PowerBall jackpot in the history of the National Lottery. Once again, this was in line with the objective that we set back in 2015: to set the benchmark for Lottery operations in South Africa and beyond.
                On this site, we provide information about winning numbers after each draw; the jackpot prizes and simplified, how to play instructions for all Lottery games. Players also have the opportunity to register to play online and enjoy the convenience of playing their favourite National Lottery games from anywhere.
